## About Me

I’m a Computer Science student at Oregon State University who enjoys building useful things—whether that’s a smart home app, a tool to share local experiences, or a system that automates daily tasks. I’ve spent time exploring different areas of tech, from backend systems and microservices to UI design and robotics. Most of my projects are built around the idea of making everyday life a little easier or more connected.

Outside of coding, I’m always thinking about new ideas—how tech can be more human, how to reduce unnecessary complexity, or how to make things more accessible. I like working on projects that solve real problems, and I try to keep learning and improving as I go.
